# To-Do List App

## Project Description
For this project, I designed a to-do list application that allows users to add tasks and mark them as completed once they are done. I utilized a combination of HTML, CSS, and EJS (Embedded JavaScript) while employing node and npm to install and update the necessary packages.

Although I encountered a few challenges when working with EJS for the first time, such as familiarizing myself with the tags required to embed JavaScript in a .ejs file, I was able to overcome them with the aid of the documentation. Despite some initial difficulties, I managed to complete the project successfully.

While I found EJS to be an intriguing tool to learn and use, I do not anticipate using it extensively in the future. Nonetheless, building something with it was a stimulating learning experience.

## What is Scope?

JavaScript has two distinct types of scope: Function Scope and Global Scope. When a variable is defined inside a function, it is only accessible within that function, creating Function Scope. On the other hand, when a variable is declared outside a function, it becomes a Global variable and can be accessed from anywhere within a JavaScript program, hence creating a Global Scope.
