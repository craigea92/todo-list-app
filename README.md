## What is Scope?

In JavaScript there are two types of Scope, Function and Global. Variables defined inside a function are not accessible from outside the function and this is known as Function Scope. A variable declared outside a function becomes Global, they can be accessed from anywhere in a JavaScript program. This is known as a Global Scope.
